At firs I pass arguments to main(2 arguments , first is count of arguments , second is array from passed arguments)
After that, I check , if the count of arguments is less then 2 , if yes , it means we should end our program .
Then in variable "result" I keep a result of chdir(arg[1]) , if its's 0 ,program will say - directory is successfully changed, 
in other cases - directory cannot be changed.
